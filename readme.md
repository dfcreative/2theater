# To-theater

A collection of famous theater plays must see.

```
$ npm run build
```

### Principles

* Every item is a sub-project with itâ€™s own folder.
* Technical info should be separated from data (to `config.json`).
* As far data needs to be translated, keep it as a frontmatter per index file.
* Each index markdown contains only infologic data, it should not contain representational nuances nor duplicates.
* Name directories and data in singular manner: _image_, not _images_; _play_, not _plays_.
